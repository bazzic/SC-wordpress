The difference between a project's success or failure can often come down to the way you manage your resources.  There is no substitute for leadership and experience when it comes to delivering complex solutions on time, on budget and on specification.  Silex Consulting understands this and has many successful projects and satisfied customers that will attest to our project management capabilities.

At Silex we do things differently.  For a start, all of our project managers bring a significant amount of technical IT experience to a project that will translate into important technical contributions and oversight to guide the project towards success. Additionally, we don't like process for its own sake, but believe in an appropriate level for each project. Whether your project requires the controls available in a PRINCE2 project, or you prefer your project to follow agile methodologies, then Silex has the experienced consultants that you need.

Silex specialises in technical software implementation and project management for the web.  For example, we can achieve the design, build and delivery of a corporate web site or the implementation of an intranet application.  We don't build roads or manage desktop application roll-outs, and this focus on web software has allowed us to develop insights that translate into savings for our customers.

<h3>Requirements Analysis</h3>
Without clear and focused requirements gathering, you are unlikely to achieve your business objectives.  You may develop a solution that is on time and on budget but which nobody needs.  This results in wasted resources and lost opportunities.  Our team will lead you through the requirements gathering phase of a project to produce specifications which will guide development and arrive at solutions that fulfil your business needs.  Whether you are building a corporate website or creating tools to help streamline your business processes, Silex has the right team and approach to meet your needs.
