The difference between a project's success or failure can often come down to the way you manage your resources.  There is no substitute for leadership and experience when it comes to delivering complex solutions on time, on budget and on spec.  Silex Consulting understands this and has many successful projects and satisfied customers that will attest to our project management capabilities

At Silex we do things differently.  For a start, all of our project managers bring a significant amount of technical IT experience to a project that will translate into important technical contributions and oversight to guide the project towards success. Additionally, we don't like process for it's own sake, but believe in an appropriate level for a project. Whether your project requires the controls available in a <a href="http://www.silex-consulting.com/services/project_management#PRINCE2">PRINCE2</a> project or if your project will only need a very light touch project management, with a sprinkling of <a href="http://www.silex-consulting.com/services/project_management#agile">agile methodologies</a>,  then Silex have the experienced consultants to implement this for you.

Silex specialises in technical software implementation project management for the web, such as the design, build and delivery of a corporate web site or implementation of an intranet application.  We don't build roads, or manage application roll-out's, and this focus on a core industry has allowed us to develop insights that translate into savings for our customers.

Whether you are building a corporate website or embarking on a project to develop tools to streamline your business processes, Silex has the right team and approach to meet your needs.
